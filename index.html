                    Arsenal Football Club is an English professional football club based in Islington,
                     London. Arsenal play in the Premier League, the top flight of English football.
                      The club has won 13 league titles (including one unbeaten title), a record 14 
                      FA Cups, two League Cups, 16 FA Community Shields, one European Cup Winners'
                       Cup, and one Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. In terms of trophies won, it is the 
                       third-most successful club in English football.
                      <br>
                      Arsenal was the first club from the South of England to join the Football League in 1893,
                      and they reached the First Division in 1904. Relegated only once, in 1913,
                       they continue the longest streak in the top division,[2] and have won the
                        second-most top-flight matches in English football history.[3] In the 1930s,
                         Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another 
                         FA Cup and two Championships after the war. In 1970–71, they won their 
                         first League and FA Cup Double. Between 1989 and 2005, they won 
                         five League titles and five FA Cups, including two more Doubles. 
                         They completed the 20th century with the highest average league position.[4]
                         Between 1998 and 2017, Arsenal qualified for the UEFA Champions League for 
                         nineteen consecutive seasons.

                 In 1886, munitions workers at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich founded the club as Dial Square.
                  In 1913 the club crossed the city to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, becoming close neighbours
                   of Tottenham Hotspur, and creating the North London derby.
